# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard
## 🧠 Project Overview:
- This interactive Power BI dashboard provides detailed insights into an e-commerce company's sales, profit, product category performance, and customer behavior across different regions of India.

## This dashboard empowers users to:
- Track monthly profits and spot loss trends
- Analyze revenue by product category
- Monitor state-wise sales performance
- Explore payment method distribution
- Use dynamic slicers (State, Quarter) to filter and drill down into key metrics
